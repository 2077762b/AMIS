            "A circular economy is an alternative to a traditional linear economy (make, use, dispose) in which we keep resources in use for as long as possible, extract the maximum value from them whilst in use, then recover and regenerate products and materials at the end of each service life." <%= link_to "WRAP to learn more", "http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/wrap-and-circular-economy", :target => "_blank" %></p>
